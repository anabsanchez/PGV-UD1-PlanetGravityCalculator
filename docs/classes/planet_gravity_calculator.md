# Planet Gravity Calculator
The PlanetGravityCalculator class calculates the gravitational acceleration of a planet based on its mass and radius. It retrieves command-line arguments for the planet's name, mass, and radius, and uses the gravitational constant to compute the gravity using its formula.
â€‹
It also handles various exceptions, such as incorrect input format, and prints the calculated gravity to the console.
